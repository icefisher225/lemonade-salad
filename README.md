A security tool for iOS. 

Hoping to make an actual Apple-worthy iOS terminal emulator for security. It has to look the part. 

### Hopeful libraries to include:
#### Pull request this list to add suggestions. 
- nmap
- ping
- dig
- curl
- wget
- yum or another package manager?

Gonna prototype in SwiftUI and hopefully use it, as I want to target my iPhone.
